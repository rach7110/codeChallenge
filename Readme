Part 1: Local API
- Routes can be found in routes/web.php
- To create a todo: http://localhost:8000/todos/create?item={"task":"go to the store", "completed":false}
- To edit a todo:   http://localhost:8000/todos/{id}/edit?item={"task":"go to the store", "completed":true}

Part 2: External API
- Request weather with valid nited States zip code. Example: http://localhost:8000/weather?zip=78704
