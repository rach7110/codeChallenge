Part 1: Create a CRUD To Do application.
_ A visiter can create a ToDo item
_ a visiter can view a Todo item ("Return one ToDo as json")
_ a visiter can view all Todo items  (Return all ToDos as json)
_ A visiter can Edit a ToDo item
_ A visiter can Delete a ToDo

Use sqlite to minimize setup and overhead.

A ToDo should have the following format:
{
	"task":(string) "Task name",
	"completed":(boolean) true/false
}

The POST and PUT requests should take the data input as JSON

Create an additional table called request_logs, using a middleware, log the request method and route being accessed, as well as the HTTP status code that the request returns.

Example:
http_status_code	request_method	route
201	                GET	            /create
